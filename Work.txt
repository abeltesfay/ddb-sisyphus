[x] Table Structure / Queries tabs selector
[x] Code re-org
[x] Add query
  - Get App by Com #5a
  - Query should contain:
    - short description, e.g.: getApplicationDetailsByApplicantId
    - long description, e.g.: Get all application documents purely by pk and part of sk using some index
      - I think we may be able to automate this once we have the below information
    - index you're using (which defines pk+sk) <dropdown>
    - field(s)/static value you're passing in to pk
    - field(s)/static value you're passing in to sk
    ^ this is where it gets complicated. need standard way of doing this so we can
      automate all the checks and etc

  [o] Create access patterns from composite keys
    - What does this look like?
      1. Create name for new query
      1. Click the fields in the facet that this relies on for querying
      1. Click the GSI this relies on? May be able to get that automatically from field
      1. Save the name + field combos
    - How is this stored in JSON?
    queries: [{ name: "Get Application by pk SK", fields: ["pk", "sk"], example: { pk: "", sk: "begins_with('lol#')" } }]
