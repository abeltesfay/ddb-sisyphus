  [-] Worked pretty well.
    - Had to re-create pk-sk fields for the Review facet, but
      wasn't a ton of work.
    - Re-creating the pk-sk fields for the Review facet allowed
      me to see exactly what the format of that field will be..
      this will be invaluable for future modifications to pk-sk
      in that it can show cascading changes we need to make
[x] Case-insensitive field filtering
[?] How do we want to handle broken relationships?
  [o] You can remove a field on a facet, but it won't cascade
      failures through to a composite field type -> index -> query
    - What should it do here? Alert the user a field doesn't exist
      on a query makes the most sense to me.
  [o] You can change the order of a composite key
    - We should alert the user of any queries that have pk/sk
      that are no longer valid/findable in our list 
[x] Query editor pk/sk should handle non composite keys
[x] Query editor pk/sk should handle no/empty sort key
[x] Update dropdown constants to be an enum

  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48523454/onbeforeunload-doesnt-work-until-mouse-is-clicked-once-in-the-body
[x] Table Structure / Queries tabs selector
[x] Code re-org
[x] Add query
  - Get App by Com #5a
  - Query should contain:
    - short description, e.g.: getApplicationDetailsByApplicantId
    - long description, e.g.: Get all application documents purely by pk and part of sk using some index
      - I think we may be able to automate this once we have the below information
    - index you're using (which defines pk+sk) <dropdown>
    - field(s)/static value you're passing in to pk
    - field(s)/static value you're passing in to sk
    ^ this is where it gets complicated. need standard way of doing this so we can
      automate all the checks and etc

  [o] Create example documents
  [o] Specify formats of fields
    - What does this mean?
      Oh.. basically link one field to be a concatenation of 2 or more other fields by a delimiter
      Actually then, this means specify composite key strings used by queries
  [o] Show us impacted queries when changing a composite key field
  [o] Create access patterns from composite keys
    - What does this look like?
      1. Create name for new query
      1. Click the fields in the facet that this relies on for querying
      1. Click the GSI this relies on? May be able to get that automatically from field
      1. Save the name + field combos
    - How is this stored in JSON?
